= Redmine Issuepoke plugin

Plugin provides simple notification system for stalled issues.

Supported versions: 4.0 - 5.0.

Plugin comments on an opened issue when it had not been updated for
specified amount of time. Actual mail notifications are sent by Redmine itself
and can be configured by Redmine administrator.

== Configuration

Plugin provides a settings page where one can specify:
* check interval - amount of days after which an issue is treated as stalled.
* comment text - placeholder '{user}' is replaced with assignee and author. Let them be ashamed!
* poke user - an user who posts notification. Admin by default.
* excluded projects - a comma-separated list of project identifiers excluded from checking.

== Launching

Plugin provides two rake tasks:
1. <tt>issuepoke:poke</tt> - Plugin find all stalled issues and updates them.

2. <tt>issuepoke:preview</tt> - Plugin find all stalled issues and prints them to STDERR without actual updating.

You can place into crontab something like that:

	0 1 * * * cd REDMINE_ROOT && bundle exec rake issuepoke:poke RAILS_ENV=production
